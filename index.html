        <p class="para">Two frogs were paying on a rainy day. Slowly, they hopped and

        <p class="para">Both the frogs tried for some time, but in vain. One of the frogs lost hope
             and said, “I can’t swim any more" and he drowned to the bottom.
             The other did not lose hope.He kept on swimming. His movements churned the milk into butter.
             The frog climbed on to a pat of butter and hopped out of the churn. 
             A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.
The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, “Did you not hear us?” The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.</p>
